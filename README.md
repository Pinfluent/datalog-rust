# Datalog in Rust

A toy implementation of naive-evaluated Datalog in Rust, based on the blog
post [The Essence of
Datalog](https://dodisturb.me/posts/2018-12-25-The-Essence-of-Datalog.html).

This implementation was coded on my [Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/seanicuscode). You can watch the recordings of those sessions on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_eVLc-qrivbvXepnYFrRlpM4kbaxb9Mo):
